In modern society, Cardiovascular disease has been the number one lethal disease in the U.S. and about 16 percent of all deaths worldwide. As individuals who are able to develop heart disease in the future, we want to find out which variable or variables have greater effects on developing heart disease so that we could try to prevent it from happening and minimize the chance of it occurring. In order to explore the major factors associated with Cardiovascular disease, we are doing extensive data exploration by using machine learning tools to predict the number of people who may face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease combined with several essential variables. Some methods that we will be using are logistic regression, the KNN neighbor classification, and the SVM as well.
